# ECM1417-space_website
This project is for my coursework as part of my ECM1417 module at the University Of Exeter.

This project is a static website that showcases the history, achievements, and future of human space exploration. 
The site is designed to educate and engage visitors by highlighting significant milestones and upcoming activities in space exploration.

2. **History** - Highlights key achievements and events in space exploration.
3. **Future** - Displays an interactive timeline of upcoming space missions.
4. **Contact** - Provides a form for feedback and an embedded Google map showing the location of the University of Exeter.
